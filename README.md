# SoundLevelMonitor

by David Jeske

This is a simple tool I cooked up so I could figure out which app was responsible for annoying errant notification sounds.

There are WPF and Windows.Forms versions. 

It has turned into a bit of a WPF performance challenge, as it's hard to match GDI's performance using WPF's retained mode drawing.
